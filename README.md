# Sharks With Laser Beams (NodeJS version)

I worked with [scrubmx](https://github.com/scrubmx/sharks-with-laser-beams) on PHP version. This project is my NodeJS version.

It's sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!

This tool is still in alpha and should not be used in production. 
Right now it is just a proof of concept.
